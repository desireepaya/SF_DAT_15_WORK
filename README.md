## SF DAT 15 Student Repository

Working portfolio for [General Assembly's Data Science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/san-francisco/)

**Introduction:**
This repository holds the code, data, and project materials related to this course, running from June through August, 2015.  It is taught in Python.

As the course progresses, I will update this README with samples demonstrating key concepts.

My final project allows me to show what I've learned using a public data source.

### Key Concepts

* [TBD]

### Useful Tools

I chose to use a Windows laptop to complete this course, mostly out of convenience.  But I was curious how someone from an enterprise standardized on Microsoft would be able to complete this type of work.

I've been pleasantly surprised to find that the tools listed below provide a robust user experience on par with similar tools available on Ubuntu.

* Git Bash
* Spyder

Setting up SSH auth for Git Bash was not difficult either.  GitHub provides a good [help article](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) on generating and testing SSH key auth.  One note of caution though: starting ssh-agent did not work as prescribed (Step 3).  I needed to use 'eval $(ssh-agent)' instead.
